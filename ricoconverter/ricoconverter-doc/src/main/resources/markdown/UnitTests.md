# Unit Tests

##Â Running unit tests

- To run unit tests, launch the batch with the command `test_ead` or `test_eac` depending if you want to run EAD or EAC tests.
- The unit tests files are located under the subfolders `unit-tests/eac2rico` and `unit-tests/ead2rico`.
- Each unit tests is a subfolder with the same structure :
	- `input.xml` is a small EAC-CPF or EAD file
	- `expected.xml` is the expected result of the stylesheet
	- `result.xml` will be generated when running the unit tests
- The console log shows a "success"/"FAILURE" message for each unit test

### Creating new unit tests

- If you modify the stylesheets, you can add directly new folders under `unit-tests/eac2rico` or `unit-tests/ead2rico`, and run the tests command of the converter. New folders will be picked up automatically.
- To write new unit tests in the source code, once you have tested them, add a subfolder under `ricoconverter/ricoconverter-convert/src/test/resources/eac2rico`, with an `input.xml` and an `expected.xml` file.
