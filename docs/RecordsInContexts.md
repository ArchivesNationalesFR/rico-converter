# Records in Contexts

Records in Contexts (RiC) is __the latest archival description standard__, that makes it possible to describe archival records and the multiple layers of contexts in which they are inscribed through time, from their creation to their curation in an archival institution. It enables archivists and records managers to move forward, from the four previous ICA description standards (ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF and ISDIAH) to __a more accurate, more nuanced, easier to process, multidimensional description__.

RiC is developed by International Council on Archives Expert Group on Archival Description ([ICA EGAD](https://www.ica.org/en/egad-steering-committee-0)).

RiC has two components for now:

- a __conceptual model (RiC-Conceptual Model or RiC-CM)__ which defines the entities that exist in the world of archives, their attributes and the relations that can connect an entity to another one. A 0.1 version of RiC-CM was published in September 2016. __The latest version of RiC-CM is RiC-CM v0.2 preview, dated December 2019, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/ric-cm-0.2_preview.pdf)__.
- an __OWL 2 ontology, (RiC-Ontology or RiC-O)__. It is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM). It provides a generic vocabulary and formal rules for creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record resource. It can support publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data, querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the ontology. __The latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O v0.1, to which RiC-O Converter is compliant, was published in December 2019__. It is fully documented in English and available here: [https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology).

Since the end of March 2020, __RiC-O sources are available on GitHub ([https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O))__, along with some examples and diagrams. You will find there the latest version of RiC-O. The GitHub repository comes with __a small information web site ([https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-O/](https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-O/))__; this is where you will find the latest news on RiC-O.

The current versions of RiC are drafts; however, they are quite close to RiC-CM and RiC-O v1.0, which will be released before the end of 2020.

If you want to get the latests news on RiC, you can also get the main information from [the ICA website](https://www.ica.org/en).
