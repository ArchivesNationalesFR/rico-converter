# Validation

## What is the validation ?

The validation is triggered by the `validate` command. It is a process that checks a RiC-O data graph against a set of validation rules, called "Shapes", and generates a validation report in TSV (Tab Separated Values) that can be opened in Excel or LibreOffice to be reviewed.

## Running the validation

### Preparing data to be validated

By default, the `validate` command reads the data to be validated in the `input-validation` directory of the script. For the validation to work properly, you need to put in this directory 3 things :

  1. The set of RiC-O files generated by the `convert_arrange` command (you can keep them in subdirectories);
  2. The set of controlled vocabularies to which the RiC-O entities refer to (you can also keep this in a subdirectory)
  3. The RiC-O ontology files;

### Running the command and reading the output

To run the command, launch the usual `eaccpf2rico.bat`, and type the command `validate` at the prompt. If you need to adjust some parameters, adjust the file `parameters\validate.properties`.

The validation report is generated by default in the file `validation-report.tsv` in the script directory (next to eaccpf2rico.bat).

## The validation report

You need to open the validation report in Excel or LibreOffice.
Each line in the validation report is a validation issue.
Each line contains the following columns :

  - `?message` : the validation message for this issue;
  - `?severity` : the severity level of the issue, usually `Violation` but can also be `Warning` or `Info`;
  - `?nodeUri` : the IRI of the node that has this issue in the data;
  - `?resultPath` : the property or path that caused the issue on the node in the data;
  - `?value` : the value of the property or path that caused the issue on the node in the data;
  - `?sourceShape` : the reference to the Shape that triggered this issue, in the shape definition file (this can be a blank node);
  - `?sourceConstraintComponent` : the constraint component on the shape that triggered the issue;
